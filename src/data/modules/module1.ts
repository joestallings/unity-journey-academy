# Unity Fundamentals

In this module, we'll cover the core concepts and components that make up the Unity engine.

## GameObjects and Components

Unity uses a component-based architecture where everything in your game is a GameObject with various Components attached.

### Key Concepts:

* **GameObjects**: The base objects in your scene
* **Components**: Building blocks that add functionality
* **Transform Component**: Controls position, rotation, and scale

## The Unity Editor Interface

The Unity Editor is where you'll spend most of your development time. Let's explore its main sections:

* Scene view - For building your game visually
* Game view - For testing how your game looks to players
* Hierarchy panel - Lists all GameObjects in the current scene
* Project panel - Shows all assets in your project
* Inspector - Displays and allows editing of selected object properties

## Working with Prefabs

Prefabs are reusable GameObject templates that allow you to:

1. Create multiple instances of complex objects
2. Update all instances by modifying the original prefab
3. Override specific properties on individual instances

## Scene Management

Understanding how to work with scenes is essential:

* Creating new scenes
* Saving and loading scenes
* Building scene hierarchies
* Using multiple scenes in your game
