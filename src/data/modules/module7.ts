# Audio Implementation

This module covers audio systems in Unity and techniques for creating an immersive sound experience.

## Audio Fundamentals

Understanding the core audio components:

* Audio Listener and Audio Source
* Audio Mixer and Audio Groups
* 2D vs. 3D sound
* Audio file formats and compression

## Background Music Systems

Implementing music systems for your game:

\`\`\`csharp
public class MusicManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip[] musicTracks;
    [SerializeField] private float crossFadeDuration = 2.0f;
    
    private AudioSource[] audioSources;
    private int activeTrack = 0;
    private int nextTrack = 1;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        // Set up two audio sources for crossfading
        audioSources = new AudioSource[2];
        audioSources[0] = gameObject.AddComponent<AudioSource>();
        audioSources[1] = gameObject.AddComponent<AudioSource>();
        
        // Start playing the first track
        PlayTrack(0);
    }
    
    public void PlayTrack(int trackIndex)
    {
        // Implement track switching with crossfade
        // ...
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Sound Effects

Managing sound effects in your game:

* One-shot vs. looping sounds
* Positional audio for 3D environments
* Creating sound effect variations
* Sound effect pooling for performance

## Audio Mixing and DSP Effects

* Creating mixer groups
* Applying effects (reverb, echo, filters)
* Dynamic mixing based on game state
* Snapshot transitions

## Adaptive Audio Systems

Creating dynamic audio that responds to gameplay:

\`\`\`csharp
void UpdateCombatMusic(int enemyCount, float playerHealth)
{
    // Adjust music intensity based on combat situation
    float intensity = Mathf.Clamp01(enemyCount / 10f * (1f - playerHealth/100f));
    
    // Adjust mixer parameters
    combatMixer.SetFloat("Intensity", intensity);
    combatMixer.SetFloat("PercussionVolume", Mathf.Lerp(-80f, 0f, intensity));
    
    // Trigger stingers if needed
    if (intensity > 0.8f && !highIntensityStingerPlayed)
    {
        PlayAudioStinger(highIntensityStinger);
        highIntensityStingerPlayed = true;
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Voice Acting Integration

* Dialogue systems and voice-over
* Subtitles and localization support
* Voice asset management
* Lip-syncing techniques
