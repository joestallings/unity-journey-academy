# Unit 1: Unity Foundations & The Editor
## Instructional Content
### 1. Introduction to Unity Hub
Unity Hub serves as the central management tool for your Unity development environment. It provides a streamlined interface for managing Unity installations, projects, and templates.
#### Key Features of Unity Hub:
**Installation Management:**
Unity Hub allows you to install and manage multiple versions of the Unity Editor simultaneously. This is particularly valuable when working on different projects that may require specific Unity versions for compatibility.
```
Unity Hub > Installs > Add > [Select Version]
```
You can install the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version, which is recommended for production projects due to its stability, or the latest Tech Stream version, which includes cutting-edge features but may have more frequent updates and potential instabilities.
**Project Management:**
Unity Hub provides a centralized location to create, open, and organize your Unity projects.
```
Unity Hub > Projects > New > [Select Template]
```
The Projects tab displays all your recent projects, allowing you to:
- Open existing projects
- Create new projects
- Sort projects by name, platform, or date
- Add projects from disk that weren't created through the Hub
**Templates:**
When creating a new project, Unity Hub offers various templates to jumpstart your development:
- 2D
- 3D
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)
- Mobile
- VR
- AR
- And more specialized templates
**Learn Tab:**
Unity Hub includes a Learn tab with tutorials and sample projects to help you get started or expand your knowledge of specific Unity features.
### 2. Creating a New 3D URP/Standard Project
Let's walk through the process of creating a new Unity project using either the Standard 3D template or the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) template.
#### Standard 3D Project:
1. Open Unity Hub
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "3D" template
4. Configure project settings:
   - Project Name: "UnityAccelerator_Course"
   - Location: Choose a directory on your system
5. Click "Create Project"
#### Universal Render Pipeline (URP) Project:
1. Open Unity Hub
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "3D (URP)" template
4. Configure project settings:
   - Project Name: "UnityAccelerator_Course_URP"
   - Location: Choose a directory on your system
5. Click "Create Project"
#### Key Differences Between Standard and URP:
**Standard Render Pipeline:**
- Simpler setup
- Fewer graphics features
- Lower performance overhead
- Easier to learn for beginners
**Universal Render Pipeline (URP):**
- More modern rendering architecture
- Better performance on a wider range of platforms
- More advanced graphics features (post-processing, lighting)
- Requires some additional setup
- Industry standard for most new projects
For this course, either option is suitable, but URP represents the direction Unity is moving toward for most projects. If you're unsure, the Standard 3D template is slightly simpler to start with, and many concepts transfer directly to URP later.
### 3. Project Folder Structure Breakdown
When you create a new Unity project, several folders are automatically generated. Understanding this structure is crucial for organizing your project effectively.
#### Core Folders:
**Assets:**
This is the primary folder where all your project files will be stored. Everything you import or create for your project should be organized within this folder.
```
Assets/
  ├── Scenes/         (Unity scene files)
  ├── Scripts/        (C# script files)
  ├── Models/         (3D models)
  ├── Materials/      (Material assets)
  ├── Textures/       (Image files)
  ├── Prefabs/        (Reusable GameObject templates)
  ├── Animations/     (Animation clips and controllers)
  └── Audio/          (Sound files)
```
The subfolders shown above are a common organization pattern, but Unity doesn't create them automatically. You'll need to create this structure yourself as your project grows.
**Library:**
This folder contains cached data generated by Unity. It includes imported assets in their Unity-ready format. You should never modify this folder manually, and it doesn't need to be included in version control systems.
**Packages:**
Contains package data for the Unity Package Manager. This includes both built-in packages and those you install from the Package Manager.
**ProjectSettings:**
Contains all the settings for your project, including input mappings, quality settings, physics settings, etc. These files are typically small text files that should be included in version control.
**Temp:**
Temporary files generated during the Unity Editor session. These are automatically cleaned up and don't need to be included in version control.
**Logs:**
Contains log files generated by the Unity Editor, useful for debugging.
**UserSettings:**
Contains user-specific settings that don't need to be shared across a team.
#### Best Practices for Project Organization:
1. **Create a clear folder structure** within Assets from the beginning
2. **Use descriptive names** for all assets
3. **Group related assets** together
4. **Consider using asset labels** for cross-category organization
5. **Keep the root Assets folder clean** by using subfolders
6. **Use consistent naming conventions** (e.g., PascalCase for folders, snake_case for files)
### 4. Deep Dive into Editor Windows
The Unity Editor interface consists of several dockable windows, each serving a specific purpose in the development workflow.
#### Scene View:
This is where you construct and edit your 3D or 2D scenes. It provides a visual representation of your game world during development.
Key features:

**Perspective/Isometric Toggle:**
- Press 5 on the numpad to switch between perspective and isometric views
**View from Specific Angles:**
- Numpad 1: Front view
- Numpad 3: Right view
- Numpad 7: Top view
- Add Ctrl to see from the opposite direction (back, left, bottom)
**Camera Alignment:**
- Ctrl + Shift + F: Align view with the selected object's orientation
#### Scene Gizmos:
In the top-right corner of the Scene view, you'll find the Scene Gizmo, which helps with orientation and quick view changes.
- **Colored axes (RGB = XYZ)**: Click an axis to view along it
- **Cube faces**: Click a face to view from that direction
- **Center cube**: Toggle between perspective and isometric views
#### Navigation Settings:
You can customize navigation speed and behavior in:
```
Edit > Preferences > Scene View
```
Adjustable settings include:
- Look around speed
- Fly around speed
- Mouse wheel speed
- Invert Y axis
#### Flythrough Mode:
For navigating large scenes:
- Hold right mouse button
- Use WASD keys to move
- Move mouse to look around
- Hold Shift to move faster
This "first-person shooter" style navigation is particularly useful in large environments.
### 6. GameObjects: The Fundamental Entities
In Unity, everything in your scene is a GameObject. Understanding this concept is fundamental to working effectively in Unity.
#### What is a GameObject?
A GameObject is a container that can hold components, which define its behavior and properties. By itself, a GameObject does nothing; it's the components attached to it that give it functionality.
Every GameObject automatically has a Transform component, which defines its position, rotation, and scale in the 3D world.
#### Creating GameObjects:
**From the Menu:**
```
GameObject > Create Empty
GameObject > 3D Object > Cube (or other primitives)
```
**By Right-Clicking in the Hierarchy:**
```
Right-click > Create Empty
Right-click > 3D Object > Cube (or other primitives)
```
**By Duplicating:**
```
Select an existing GameObject > Ctrl+D (or Cmd+D on Mac)
```
#### GameObject Properties:
In the Inspector, every GameObject has these basic properties:
- **Name**: Identifier in the Hierarchy
- **Tag**: Category for quick identification in scripts
- **Layer**: Used for rendering order, physics collisions, and raycasting
- **Static flags**: Optimization options for objects that don't move
- **Active checkbox**: Enables/disables the GameObject
#### Parent-Child Relationships:
GameObjects can be nested to create hierarchies. This is useful for:
- **Organization**: Grouping related objects
- **Relative transformations**: Children inherit their parent's position, rotation, and scale
- **Collective operations**: Enable/disable multiple objects at once
To create a parent-child relationship:
- Drag a GameObject onto another in the Hierarchy
- Or use Ctrl+Alt+P to parent the selected object to the previously selected object
#### Empty GameObjects:
Empty GameObjects have only a Transform component and no visible representation in the scene. They're useful for:
- **Organization**: Acting as folders in the Hierarchy
- **Spawn points**: Marking locations in the scene
- **Script containers**: Holding scripts that don't need a visual representation
- **Pivot points**: Creating custom rotation centers for groups of objects
### 7. Components: Building Blocks of Functionality
Components are the functional building blocks that give GameObjects their behavior and properties.
#### Core Concepts:
- Every GameObject has at least one component: Transform
- Components are modular and reusable
- Multiple components can be attached to a single GameObject
- Components can interact with each other
- Unity includes many built-in components, and you can create custom ones with scripts
#### Adding Components:
**Via Inspector:**
```
Select GameObject > Click "Add Component" in Inspector > Search or browse categories
```
**Via Menu:**
```
Component > Physics > Rigidbody (for example)
```
**Via Script:**
```csharp
gameObject.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();
```
#### Common Built-in Components:
**Transform:**
- Present on all GameObjects
- Defines position, rotation, and scale
- Manages parent-child relationships
**Mesh Filter & Mesh Renderer:**
- Work together to display 3D models
- Mesh Filter: References the 3D model data
- Mesh Renderer: Handles how the mesh is rendered (materials, shadows, etc.)
**Colliders:**
- Define physical shape for collisions
- Types include Box, Sphere, Capsule, Mesh Collider
- Can be triggers (detect overlaps without physical collision)
**Rigidbody:**
- Enables physics simulation
- Adds mass, gravity, and forces
- Controls how objects interact physically
**Camera:**
- Defines a viewpoint for rendering the scene
- Controls field of view, clipping planes, and rendering settings
**Light:**
- Illuminates the scene
- Types include Directional, Point, Spot, and Area lights
**Audio Source & Audio Listener:**
- Audio Source: Plays sounds
- Audio Listener: Receives sounds (typically attached to the main camera)
**Animator:**
- Controls animations
- Works with Animation Controllers
**Scripts:**
- Custom components written in C#
- Can access and modify other components
- Define custom behavior
#### Component Communication:
Components on the same GameObject can communicate through:
```csharp
// Get a reference to another component on the same GameObject
Rigidbody rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
// Get a component from a child GameObject
Light childLight = GetComponentInChildren<Light>();
// Get a component from a parent GameObject
Canvas parentCanvas = GetComponentInParent<Canvas>();
```
Components on different GameObjects can communicate through:
```csharp
// Find a GameObject by name and get its component
GameObject player = GameObject.Find("Player");
PlayerController controller = player.GetComponent<PlayerController>();
// Find a GameObject by tag and get its component
GameObject mainCamera = GameObject.FindWithTag("MainCamera");
Camera cam = mainCamera.GetComponent<Camera>();
```
### 8. Scene Setup: Creating and Manipulating Primitives
Unity provides primitive 3D shapes that are useful for prototyping, creating simple objects, or building more complex structures.
#### Available Primitives:
- **Cube**: Basic building block, useful for walls, platforms, etc.
- **Sphere**: Useful for planets, balls, or rounded objects
- **Capsule**: Good for character controllers or pills
- **Cylinder**: Useful for pillars, wheels, or containers
- **Plane**: Flat surface, often used for ground
- **Quad**: 2D rectangle, useful for UI elements or simple sprites
- **Empty**: No visible geometry, useful as a container or marker
#### Creating Primitives:
```
GameObject > 3D Object > [Select Primitive]
```
Or right-click in the Hierarchy:
```
Right-click > 3D Object > [Select Primitive]
```
#### Manipulating Transforms:
**Using the Transform Tools:**
The toolbar at the top of the editor contains three main transform tools:
- **Move Tool (W)**: Translate objects along axes
- **Rotate Tool (E)**: Rotate objects around axes
- **Scale Tool (R)**: Resize objects along axes
**Transform Gizmos:**
When a GameObject is selected, colored arrows appear in the Scene view:
- **Red Arrow (X-axis)**: Move/rotate/scale along the X-axis
- **Green Arrow (Y-axis)**: Move/rotate/scale along the Y-axis
- **Blue Arrow (Z-axis)**: Move/rotate/scale along the Z-axis
**Precise Transformations:**
For precise control, use the Transform component in the Inspector:
- Enter exact values for Position, Rotation, and Scale
- Reset to default values by right-clicking the Transform component and selecting "Reset"
**Snapping:**
Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) while moving, rotating, or scaling to snap to grid or angle increments.
Configure snapping settings in:
```
Edit > Snap Settings
```
#### Materials and Colors:
To add color to primitives, you need to create and apply materials:
1. In the Project window, right-click > Create > Material
2. Name the material (e.g., "RedMaterial")
3. In the Inspector, click on the Albedo color picker to choose a color
4. Drag the material from the Project window onto a primitive in the Scene view
#### Duplicating and Arranging:
- **Duplicate**: Select an object and press Ctrl+D (or Cmd+D on Mac)
- **Multi-select**: Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and click multiple objects
- **Align**: Use the transform values in the Inspector to align objects precisely
### 9. Saving Scenes and Projects
Properly saving your work is crucial to avoid losing progress and to maintain an organized project.
#### Saving Scenes:
A scene is a collection of GameObjects that represents a level, menu, or any discrete part of your game.
**Save Current Scene:**
```
File > Save
```
Or press Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)
**Save Scene As:**
```
File > Save As...
```
This creates a new scene file, useful for creating variations or backups.
**Scene File Location:**
Scenes should be saved in your Assets/Scenes folder for organization.
#### Creating New Scenes:
**Create a New Scene:**
```
File > New Scene
```
This creates an empty scene with only a default directional light and a camera.
**Scene Templates:**
Unity provides scene templates with different lighting setups:
```
File > New Scene > [Select Template]
```
#### Saving Projects:
Unity automatically saves your project settings and assets as you work. However, there are some best practices to follow:
**Save Before Play Mode:**
Always save your scene before entering Play mode, as changes made during Play mode are discarded when you exit.
**Save Scene After Significant Changes:**
Get in the habit of saving frequently, especially after making significant changes.
**Project Backups:**
Regularly create backups of your entire project folder:
- Copy the project folder to a backup location
- Use version control systems like Git
- Use Unity Collaborate (available through Unity Teams)
#### Version Control Integration:
Unity works well with version control systems:
1. Enable external version control in:
```
Edit > Project Settings > Editor > Version Control
```
2. Configure which files to ignore (typically Library, Temp, and Logs folders)
3. Use the Unity-specific settings for your version control system (e.g., Git LFS for large binary files)
